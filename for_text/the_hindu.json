            "Mr. Shivakumar, who was on city rounds on Sunday morning stopped his convoy at Chokkasandra (ward 39) in Dasarahalli to have breakfast at Indira Canteen at around 9 a.m. When he asked for breakfast, not just for himself, but for also people accompanying him, a worker said no food was left to serve. On questioning the staff about the quantum of food that was supplied to the canteen, the worker said the canteen had sold all 208 plates. ",

            "Mr. Shivakumar took up the issue with the canteen staffer and warned him against repeating the same. He also found that the toll-free helpline to register complaints about grievances in the canteens was not working and directed officials to fix the same. He said the State government’s priority is to provide quality food in the canteens to the public at low prices. ",
            "It should be noted that the canteens are still serving the old menu and new menu is yet to be implemented. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has sought permission from the Urban Development Department to float tenders for the new menu and revamping of canteens. The sources in the BBMP said the government is expected to give its nod soon. ",

            "Freedom of the press is important. So is its social responsibility, which must begin with interaction with and accountability to readers. For a daily newspaper, this must happen on a daily basis. The Hindu has announced its appointment of the first Readers' Editor in its 127 year old history. These terms of reference for the independent, full-time ombudsman of the newspaper should be of interest to our 3.75 million-plus readers, and to all streams of the Indian news media.",
            "Preamble",
            "The Hindu believes it is the first newspaper in the history of Indian journalism to appoint a Readers' Editor. The Readers' Editor will be the independent, full-time internal ombudsman of The Hindu .",

            "The Hindu wishes to acknowledge that it has been inspired to do this by the exemplary practice and experience of The Guardian , U.K., over the past decade in a crucial area of newspaper performance. It hereby adopts, with minor modifications, the terms of reference worked out for The Guardian's Readers' Editor:",
            "Terms of Reference",
            "To collect, consider, investigate, respond to, and where appropriate come to a conclusion about readers' comments, concerns, and complaints in a prompt and timely manner, from a position of independence within the paper.",

            "To create new channels of communication with and greater responsiveness to readers, whether by email, telephone, the Internet, surface mail, or through the columns of the paper.",
            "To seek the views and, where appropriate, the written comments, of journalists whose work is the focus of readers' concerns: to take these views into account when responding to readers, and to make critical appraisals, if judged necessary, on an objective and fully-informed basis.",
            "To look for ways of improving the paper's work and performance, in the broadest sense, by collating and analysing readers' concerns, ideas, and suggestions and identifying possible new or alternative courses of action and ways to develop the paper for the benefit of its readers and the paper itself.",

            "To use this column as a platform and forum for readers' views.",
            "To require of the Editor-in-Chief that he or she take steps to ensure that his or her staff co-operate fully and promptly with the Readers' Editor should they be requested to provide assistance in responding to readers' concerns and complaints. Similarly, the management and marketing departments of the newspaper insofar as their activities relate to readers' concerns about editorial content.",
            "In consultation with the Editor-in-Chief and/or his or her nominee, to decide whether and when a correction should be published and/or apologies tendered, when deemed necessary, insofar as any correction/apology is not the subject of, or may be prejudicial to, a current complaint to the Press Council of India, our defence of an actual or possible legal action against the paper, or actual or possible legal or other action by the affected journalist(s).",
            "In order to keep fully in touch with the workings of the paper, the Readers' Editor shall have an established right of access to the Editor-in-Chief, to heads of department meetings, to planning and review meetings, to daily editorial and news conferences, and to other relevant forums. The Readers' Editor should be available to report, on an ad hoc basis, to the Editor-in-Chief and to these other groupings. The existence of the Readers' Editor, and how to contact him or her, should be advertised fairly prominently on a daily basis in the paper.",
            "The Readers' Editor can refer to the external ombudsman, should the newspaper decide to appoint one, any substantial grievances or matters whereby The Hindu's journalistic integrity has been called into question.",

            " in the form of an orbiter and a lander (‘Vikram’) bearing a rover (‘Pragyan’). While the orbiter entered into orbit around the moon, the surface mission failed in September when the lander crashed instead of executing a slow descent. ISRO later identified a problem in the guidance software and unexpected dispersion in the propulsion system during certain phases of the descent. In Chandrayaan-3, the rocket will place the payload in an elliptical orbit around the earth, where a propulsion module will take over and pilot the lander to a circular orbit around the moon. Finally, the lander will detach and begin a series of manoeuvres culminating in a gradual landing (on August 23-24 this year) over the surface. To improve the chances of success at this stage, ISRO has strengthened the lander’s legs, lowered its minimum thrust, enhanced the availability of power, and upgraded the landing sequence.",
            "This will be India’s second attempt to soft-land a lander and rover on the lunar surface, and demonstrate end-to-end capability in the relevant technologies. Soft-landing on the moon is a complicated exercise and the possibility of failure exists, even if it may be lower — yet there is good reason to focus on the consequences of a complete success. The mission will play out with India’s decision to join the Artemis Accords in the backdrop; in this group, if the mission succeeds, the country will be just the second to have soft-landed a rover on the moon. The importance of this feat cannot be overstated: a slew of public and private moon-landing missions is in the works worldwide as the establishment of permanent bases on the natural satellite has emerged as a major geopolitical goal. The Accords define the U.S.-led axis while China and Russia are working on an ‘International Lunar Research Station’. The success of Chandrayaan-3 will also make it the surface mission closest to the lunar south pole to date, a region of the moon that has been found to be geologically unique and host to spots in permanent shadow. To study these and other features, the mission has six scientific payloads. A seventh instrument, on the propulsion module, will profile the signs of life on earth to help scientists look for similar signs on planets beyond the solar system. Taken together, Chandrayaan-3 offers opportunities for India to lead the world’s response to the moon’s growing importance in the scientific and the political milieus.\r",

            "Living our Values: Code of Editorial Values",
            "This Code of Editorial Values has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Kasturi & Sons Ltd. on April 18, 2011.",
            "Trust",
            "The greatest asset of The Hindu , founded in September 1878, is trust. Everything we do as a company revolves, and should continue to revolve, round this hard-earned and inestimable long-term asset. The objective of codification of editorial values is to protect and foster the bond of trust between our newspapers and their readers.",
            "Integrity",
            "The Company must continue to protect the integrity of the newspapers it publishes, their editorial content, and the business operations that sustain and help grow the newspapers.",
            "Fair, Just and Secular",
            "Our editorial values are rooted in the guiding principles The Hindu set out with and communicated to its readers in 'Ourselves,' the editorial published in its inaugural issue of September 20, 1878. The world has changed but the principles remain vital for us: fairness and justice. The founding editorial also announces the aim of promoting 'harmony' and 'union' (unity) among the people of India and a secular editorial policy of maintaining the 'strictest neutrality' in matters relating to religion while offering fair criticism and comment 'when religious questions involve interests of a political and social character.'",
            "Core Editorial Values",
            "The core editorial values, universally accepted today by all trustworthy newspapers and newspaper-owning companies, are truth-telling, freedom and independence, fairness and justice, good responsible citizenship, humaneness, and commitment to the social good. Practising these values requires, among other things, the Company's journalists excelling in the professional disciplines, and especially the discipline of verifying everything that is published. It requires our journalists to maintain independence from those they cover, be fair and just in their news coverage, and avoid conflicts of interest. It means being interesting and innovative, and learning and mastering new ways and techniques of storytelling and presentation of editorial content in this digital age so as to engage readers and promote a lively and mutually beneficial conversation with them. Above all, it means the uncompromising practice of editorial integrity. In keeping with the exemplary tradition of a general daily newspaper of record and consistent with contemporary best practice, The Hindu shall, as a rule, maintain a clear distinction between news, critical analysis, and opinion in its editorial content and shall not editorialise or opinionate in news reports. The Company must endeavour to provide in its publications a fair and balanced coverage of competing interests, and to offer the readers diverse, reasonable viewpoints, subject to its editorial judgment.",
            "Alignment of Editorial and Business",
            "The Company is fully committed to these values, so that the business and editorial departments and actions, while operating by their own distinctive rules, are on the same page. The two sides must work together closely on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation and in the spirit of living these values in a contemporary sense.",
            "Business Focus",
            "The Company recognises that good journalism cannot survive, develop, and flourish unless it is viable and commercially successful.",
            "Transparency",
            "Any potential conflict of interest within the Company will be resolved keeping in mind these values. Among other things, this involves raising the standards of transparency and disclosure in accordance with the best contemporary norms and practices in the field.",
            "Communicating Standards",
            "It is necessary to set and communicate internally and to the public clear standards of journalistic integrity and performance, corporate governance, and business practice.",
            "No Wall but Firm Line",
            "There is no wall but there is a firm line between the business operations of the Company and editorial operations and content. Pursuant to the above-mentioned values and objectives, it is necessary to create a professionalism in the editorial functioning independent of Shareholder interference so as to maintain an impartiality, fairness, and objectivity in editorial and journalistic functioning.",

            "The announcement was made possible after U.S. President Joe Biden last year issued an executive order updating U.S. intelligence agencies' rules when it came to snooping on international data flows to give \"safeguards\" to European Union citizens and residents, the EU executive said.",
            "Biden on Monday said the deal reflected a \"joint commitment\" by both the EU and U.S. to guaranteeing privacy for citizens.",
            "It would also deepen transatlantic ties that were \"founded on our shared democratic values and vision for the world,\" a statement said.",
            "Umbrella groups representing tech companies, whose business models depend on transatlantic data exchanges, hailed the announcement of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.",
            "It was \"good news for thousands of businesses,\" one of them, DigitalEurope, said in a statement.",
            "A U.S. grouping, The Software Alliance (BSA), said it would \"bolster the management of data across borders - a cornerstone of our modern economy - and improve safeguards for citizens of the EU and U.S. alike\".",
            "Challenge looming",
            "But Max Schrems, an Austrian legal activist whose challenges led to EU courts shooting down two previous EU-US attempts on data transfers, said this one, too, would fail to satisfy EU law.",
            "The latest framework still has \"the fundamental problem\" that the United States \"takes the view that only U.S. persons are worthy of constitutional rights\" protecting them from American electronic snooping, he said.",
            "He vowed to challenge the latest effort, predicting the case \"will be likely back at the Court of Justice (of the EU) in a matter of months\".",
            "EU justice commissioner Didier Reynders told journalists he had \"no illusion\" about the coming likely legal challenge.",
            "\"But it's maybe useful to test the new U.S. system before to challenge such an adequacy decision,\" he said.",
            "Reynders added, in an apparent swipe at Schrems's non-profit European Centre for Digital Rights, that \"maybe the access to the court of justice is a small part of the business model of some civil society organisations\".",
            "Presidential order",
            "The European Commission argued that the new framework offered \"significant improvements\" over the previous data-transfer mechanism, called Privacy Shield, which the EU court deemed inadequate.",
            "The commission said U.S. companies signing onto the EU-US Data Privacy Framework would be required to delete Europeans' personal data when it was no longer needed for the purpose it was collected. ",
            "Its scope applies to citizens of the 27-nation EU and of associated countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, as well as residents in all those countries. ",
            "They would have the right to redress if they found their data was wrongly handled by US companies.",
            "Under U.S. law, Americans are protected from electronic spying by U.S. intelligence agencies by their constitution, but all other nationalities are fair game. ",
            "While Biden's October 2022 executive order does not extend that same protection to Europeans, it does oblige U.S. intelligence agencies to show data-collection on foreigners is \"proportionate\" to a specified U.S. national security objective.",
            "It also adds oversight to the handling of personal data collected, and offers a path to \"redress\" for citizens of \"qualifying states\", which is meant to include those of the EU.",
            "A new U.S. Data Protection Review Court, made up of experts from outside the American government, would be able to review data decisions made inside the U.S. office of the Director of National Intelligence.",

            "The new policy aimed at introducing a series of progressive and pragmatic measures to address the challenges of unplanned and unregulated urbanisation has received approval of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. ",
            "Presently, 19% of Odisha’s population resides in urban areas which is expected to reach 21% by 2031. The growth of census towns or peri-urban areas account for nearly 40% of the urbanisation in the State. ",
            "According to a government statement, the existing system of notification of a rural area as an urban area brings about abrupt changes in the political and administrative set-up, impacting the citizens’ socio-economic conditions as there is no window period for them to accommodate the sudden change. ",
            "Stating that these peri-urban and ‘rurban [rural-urban]’ areas were grappling with the challenge of inadequate access to social infrastructure and civic amenities and services even after declaring such areas as urban areas, the government attributed the situation to the absence of a comprehensive policy and robust institutions to contain unplanned urbanisation.",
            "As a significant shift from the previous system, the Rural-Urban Transition Policy aims to provide urban civic amenities to the people in the identified rural areas much before the areas are formally notified as urban areas. ",
            "“Now, rural areas after an intensive process of identification will be declared as urban areas coming into effect from the date on which the tenure of the existing elected representatives expires,” the policy says. ",
            "“During the interim period, the notified rural area will be taken up for up-gradation of infrastructure and services to provide all urban services on par with the adjacent urban areas. Moreover, ward delimitation and other administrative measures will also be put in place so that from the effective date, the area will start functioning as a full-fledged urban area with all required urban infrastructure and services,” it says.

            " following the abrogation of Article 370 on August 4, 2019 has “no bearing on the constitutional challenge” to the repeal of the provision.",
            "The Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud and four of the senior most judges said it would start hearing the case from August 2. ",
            "The Constitution Bench deleted the names of bureaucrat Shah Faesal and activist Shehla Rasheed from the petitioners. ",
            "With the deletion of Mr. Faesal, whose name was part of the cause title, from the array of petitioners, the case would now be called ‘In re: Article 370 of the Constitution’.\r",
            "The court observed that the Home Ministry affidavit, filed on the eve of the Constitution Bench hearing, only sets out the “perspective of the Union Government regarding the post abrogation of Article 370 developments has no bearing on the issues raised in the petitions and shall not hence be relied upon for that purpose”.",
            "“This case concerns a pure constitutional challenge,” Chief Justice Chandrachud observed.\r",
            "The petitioners, represented by senior advocates like Rajeev Dhavan, Dushyant Dave, Raju Ramachandran, Gopal Sankaranarayanan, C.U. Singh, Nitya Ramakrishnan and advocates Kamini Jaiswal, Vrinda Grover, Prasanna S., said the “legal challenge remains” despite what the Centre’s views about life in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation.",
            "In its 20-page affidavit, the Centre claimed that post abrogation of Article 370, which deprived Jammu and Kashmir of its special privileges, “life has returned to normalcy in the region after over three decades of turmoil”.\r",
            "The Ministry has said the “street violence”, which was engineered by terrorists and secessionist networks have become a “thing of the past”.\r",
            "Organised stone-pelting incidents, linked to the terrorism-separatist agenda, have come down from 1767 in 2018 to zero in 2023, the Centre has said. Bandhs and hartals have also become a distant memory. “Resolute anti-terror actions” have dismantled the “terror eco-system” which has led to a significant drop in terror recruitment from 199 in 2018 to 12 in 2023 till date, the MHA has said.\r",
            "The government said it has “encouraged policies to mainstream youth” to “wean them away from militancy”. Moreover, the Centre said that work on transit accommodation for the safe return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley was in an “advanced stage and is expected to be majorly completed in the next one year”.\r",
            "The Article 370 case has been pending in the Supreme Court for over two years. The case had not come up after a five-judge Bench refused to refer the petitions to a larger Bench in March 2020.\r",
            "The petitions have challenged a Presidential Order of August 5, 2019 which blunted Article 370. The Article had accorded special rights and privileges to the people of Jammu and Kashmir since 1954 in accordance with the Instrument of Accession. The special status was bestowed on Jammu and Kashmir by incorporating Article 35A in the Constitution. Article 35A was incorporated by an order of President Rajendra Prasad in 1954 on the advice of the Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet. The Parliament was not consulted when the President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution through a Presidential Order issued under Article 370.\r",
            "Following the abrogation, the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Act of 2019 came into force and bifurcated the State of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. In a day, Jammu and Kashmir had lost its full Statehood and became a Union Territory of the Central Government. The move had been preceded by a state of lockdown in the Valley.",
            "The various petitions have challenged the Centre’s “unilateral” move to impose curfew and unravel the unique federal structure of India by dividing Jammu and Kashmir “without taking consent from the people”.\r",
            "They have questioned the Centre’s sudden move to “unilaterally unravel the unique federal scheme, under cover of President’s Rule, while undermining crucial elements of due process and the rule of law”.\r",
            "Separate petitions have contended that the August 5 Order and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019 were arbitrary. They have also challenged the proclamation of President’s Rule in the State in December 2018.\r",
            "The petitions have said what happened to Jammu and Kashmir “goes to the heart of Indian federalism”. Thay argue that the Presidential Order of August 5 substituted the concurrence of the Governor of the State Government to change the very character of a federal unit.",
            "They said the Presidential Order took cover of a temporary situation, meant to hold the field until the return of the elected government, to accomplish a fundamental, permanent and irreversible alteration of the status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir without the concurrence, consultation or recommendation of the people of that State, acting through their elected representatives.\r",
            "They have argued that it amounted to the overnight abrogation of the democratic rights and freedoms guaranteed to the people of Jammu and Kashmir upon its accession.\r",
            "The basic purpose of Article 370 was to facilitate the extension of constitutional provisions to the State in an incremental and orderly manner, based upon the needs and requirements, without dismantling the State Constitution.\r",
            "The August 5 Order, by replacing the recommendation of the ‘Constituent Assembly’ with that of the ‘Legislative Assembly’ in order to alter the terms of Article 370, assumed that the legislative assembly of the State of Jammu and Kashmir had a power that its own Constitution, under Article 147, denied to it. Thus, the August 5 Order was ineffective, the petitions have alleged.\r",
            "The government has countered that the Presidential Order of August 5 has become ‘fait accompli’.",

            "In a piece on the origins of Mickey Haller, author Michael Connelly says the germ of the idea for a defense attorney who prefers to work out of a car rather than an office, came from multiple sources including a librarian who forced a young Connelly to read if he wanted to enjoy the air-conditioning in muggy Florida. The book Connelly read was Harper Lee’s ",
            ". Haller shares some DNA with the upright lawyer, Atticus Finch, just like that other defense attorney championing the hopeless on our screens —",
            "The Lincoln Lawyer Season 2 (English)",
            "Connelly’s 2005 novel, ",
            "was made into a film in 2011 starring Matthew McConaughey. Season 1 of David E. Kelley’s show of the same name is based on Connelly’s ",
            "(2008) while Season 2 is based on 2011’s ",
            ". Now that we have got that out of the way, let us wade into Part 1 of Season 2 — dividing a season in two also seems to be a thing, just like ",
            "Season 2, like Season 1, opens with violence in a parking lot. Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is beaten up and the five episodes in Part 1 tell us how he got there. After his success in defending Trevor Elliott (Christopher Gorham), Haller’s practice is booming. Team Haller includes his two ex-wives, criminal prosecutor Maggie McPherson (Neve Campbell), with whom he has a daughter, Hayley (Krista Warner), and Lorna Crane (Becki Newton), who basically holds his business together. There is former addict and Haller’s driver, Izzy (Jazz Raycole), and his investigator and Lorna’s soon-to-be husband Cisco (Angus Sampson). ",
            "As Lorna prepares for the wedding, she feels Cisco is keeping secrets from her — maybe returning to his biker days with the Road Saints Motorcycle Club. He is taking secret calls from one of his biker buddies, Kaz (Douglas Bennett), which throws Lorna off-kilter. There is the business of Jésus Menendez (Saul Huezo), which Haller tidies up neatly before the big one comes along — Lisa Trammell (Lana Parrilla), is the last name a hint or a clue? Lisa, a chef and the last one holding out against a real estate developer, is accused of his murder.",
            "Lisa was seen near the crime scene and has been vocal against the developer’s gentrification project. Also complicating matters is Haller’s relationship with Lisa. The criminal prosecutor, Andy (Yaya DaCosta), is a formidable opponent and Haller has to try and figure out what she is hiding. Despite Haller expressly telling Lisa not to engage with podcaster Henry Dahl (Matt Angel), she does so for the best of reasons. ",
            "The five episodes move smoothly along just like Haller’s gorgeous Lincoln town car complete with sassy personalised number plates. The acting is competent as is the writing and the action. The wide shots of the city of angels are seductive whether in the glistening day or glittering night. The music, while not all moody jazz—that would be for Haller’s half brother, Hieronymus Bosch, is just as smooth. Part 1 of Season 2 has gone full circle to return to a badly beaten Haller on the floor of a parking lot. And now we have to wait for August 3 to find out whether Trammel is an unfortunate name.",

            "“Foxconn is working toward submitting an application related to the ‘Modified Programme for Semiconductors and Display Fab Ecosystem,’” the firm said in an FAQ document shared with the media on Tuesday (July 11). Foxconn will require partners as it does not itself possess chip technology as a contract manufacturer. It is unclear if it has found any such partners yet.",
            "“We understand there is a lot of interest in Foxconn’s plans and India’s information ecosystem is porous,” the company said, adding that it maintained open lines of communication with the government leading up to the breakdown of the deal. “However, due to the competitive and sensitive issues involved in negotiating large scale investments, Foxconn is unable to disclose more information at this time.”",
            "“We welcome a diverse set of stakeholders, both inside India and abroad, who also want to see India get to the next level and can complement Foxconn’s world class supply chain management and manufacturing efficiency,” the company said. “Building fabs from scratch in a new geography is a challenge, but Foxconn is committed to invest in India,” it added.",
            "Foxconn blamed its calling off of the JV (“after heavy considerations”) on “challenging gaps we were not able to smoothly overcome, as well as external issues unrelated to the project”. Media reports cited demands by the government that the technology provider for the JV — neither Foxconn nor Vedanta had the tech and would have had to license it — also be an investor in the undertaking, which could not happen. ",

            "The Public Works Department (PWD) in Puducherry has planned to set up a one MLD (million litres per day) desalination plant on a pilot basis in the city, to overcome the depletion of groundwater sources and to meet the ever-expanding drinking water requirements of residents in the urban agglomeration limits.",

            "According to official sources, Puducherry is currently dependent on over 100 deep tube wells in the urban and peripheral areas for the city’s day-to-day water needs. As many as 220 million litres of water are supplied through pipelines to overhead reservoirs located in the urban limits. With water being extracted for over 16 to 20 hours per day to meet the rising demand, the quality of water has started deteriorating over a period. As a result, various parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), pH, nitrate, iron, and chloride have increased over the permissible levels.",
            "“The desalination plant is proposed to be set up on 2.5 acres of land in the city limits with an additional provision to upscale it in the future, considering the rising demand for water in Puducherry. The treated water will be exclusively meant for drinking water purposes and will conform to Indian Standards IS 10500 (2012). The plant will require a power requirement of 500 KW and meet the drinking water requirement of a population of 1.75 lakh,” said Secretary to Government, (PWD) D. Manikandan.",
            "The Government is looking at options for availing of financial assistance either through a negotiated loan or under existing schemes of the Central Government. If the project is approved, the plant will be set up in the next seven months. The economic feasibility of the project will determine further demand for the establishment of similar plants in the U.T, Mr. Manikandan added.",

            "In an October 2022 hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the government, had however ventured his personal opinion that the remarks made in the Ayodhya judgment about the 1991 Act would not preclude the court from examining the validity of the statute now.\r",

            " In the drinking water indicator, the percentage of people who are multidimensionally poor and deprived fell from 16.4 to 2.7 during the period, electricity (from 29% to 2.1%) and housing from 44.9% to 13.6%.",
            " The report said that countries with different incidences of poverty also halved their global MPI value. While 17 countries that did so had an incidence under 25% in the first period, India and Congo had a starting incidence above 50%.",
            " India was among the 19 countries that halved their global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) value during one period - for India it was 2005/2006–2015/2016.",
            " According to the 2023 release, 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people (just more than 18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 110 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (534 million) and South Asia (389 million) are home to approximately five out of every six poor people.",
            " Nearly two-thirds of all poor people (730 million people) live in middle-income countries, making action in these countries vital for reducing global poverty. Although low-income countries constitute only 10% of the population included in the MPI, these are where 35% of all poor people reside.",
            " Children under the age of 18 account for half of MPI-poor people (566 million). The poverty rate among children is 27.7%, while among adults, it is 13.4%. Poverty predominantly affects rural areas, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas. Rural areas are poorer than urban areas across all regions of the world.",
            " Countries halved their MPI in periods as short as four to 12 years, demonstrating the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of halving poverty according to national definitions within 15 years.",
            "“Thus, it is crucial to consider context-specific multidimensional poverty indices that reflect national definitions of poverty since the global MPI assesses multidimensional poverty with the same methodology,” the report said.",
            " The agencies, however, added that despite these encouraging trends, the lack of post-pandemic data for most of the 110 countries covered by the global MPI restricts the understanding of the pandemic's effects on poverty.",
            " “As we reach the mid-point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we can clearly see that there was steady progress in multidimensional poverty reduction before the pandemic,\" the Director of the Human Development Report Office, Pedro Conceição, said.",
            " \"However, the negative impacts of the pandemic in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is imperative that we intensify efforts to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected, necessitating strengthened data collection and policy efforts to get poverty reduction back on track,” Mr. Conceição added.",
            " A press release issued by the UNDP said that judging from the few countries where data were solely collected in 2021 or 2022 – Mexico, Madagascar, Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria – momentum on poverty reduction may have persisted during the pandemic.",
            " Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria showed significant reductions in their most recent periods, offering hope that progress is still possible. In Cambodia, the most encouraging case among these, the incidence of poverty fell from 36.7% to 16.6%, and the number of poor people halved, from 5.6 million to 2.8 million, all within 7.5 years, including the pandemic years (2014–2021/22).",
            " However, the full impacts globally remain to be measured, it said. With a renewed emphasis on data collection, “we need to broaden the picture to include the impacts of the pandemic on children,\" the press release said.",
            " \"In over half the countries covered, there was either no statistically significant reduction in child poverty or the MPI value fell more slowly among children than among adults during at least one period. This suggests that child poverty will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition,” it said.",
            " Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford, Sabina Alkire, said the scarcity of data on multidimensional poverty is hard to comprehend, let alone justify.",
            " “The world is reeling under a data deluge and gearing up for the next era of digital growth. Yet we do not have a post-pandemic line of sight for 1 billion of the 1.1 billion poor people,” Ms. Alkire said.",
            " “This problem is eminently solvable – data on multidimensional poverty are faster to gather than most realise – requiring just 5% of questions in the surveys we use. We call on funders and data scientists to make a breakthrough on poverty data, so the interconnected deprivations that strike poor people in real-time can be tracked – and intercepted,” she added.",
            " The global MPI monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives – from access to education and health to living standards such as housing, drinking water, sanitation and electricity.",
            " The MPI as a poverty index can be pictured as a stacked tower of the interlinked deprivations experienced by poor individuals, with the aim of eliminating these deprivations. ",

            "That is how Rahul Prasad a.k.a Renao wandered into the world of music. Growing up as a talented badminton player, Rahul who had represented Karnataka at the national level, was pretty sure the Olympics was where he was headed. That was until he attended an Avicii concert. ",
            "“It was my first music concert and I learnt all his songs so I’d be cool in front of my friends,” he candidly admits, adding, “I was blown away by the experience! When I got back home, I spent my spare time on YouTube trying to figure out the special effects and the entire electronic music experience.” ",
            "Like many a sportsperson, Rahul was exempt from regular classes. “The option to appear for PU exams without attending classes gave me ample time to train; on the flip side, it left me without too many friends and that is when I turned to music. ",
            "\nArtiste Renao\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n",
            "By the time he was 19 and ready to enrol in college, Rahul was the state topper in badminton and among the top 10 in the country. “I knew I had to choose and though I was better at badminton than music, I couldn’t think of giving it up. That decision saw me relocate to Leeds in the United Kingdom to study music production.”",
            "Once there, Rahul began to appreciate the nuances of ambient EDM (electronic dance music). “I saw other artistes were also playing instruments or participating as backing vocalists for their music; it encouraged me to take up voice lessons too.” ",
            "Catapult to fame",
            "For almost a year after that, Rahul began to work on the kind of music he wanted to make as well as perfecting his sound. Towards the end of 2021, he posted his song , ‘Nobody’ on TikTok. “It was just the last 30 seconds of the song, but when I woke up the next morning, it had garnered 400,000 views! It was unthinkable!”",
            "Rahul says his life took a turn with the success of ‘Nobody’ — any video posted with that song would get numerous hits. ",
            "\nArtiste Renao\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n",
            "“My life became fast-paced soon after and I signed my first label; I was working on my EP. The problem is when you enjoy a moment like that, you want to keep hitting those numbers; you get lost in the likes, the number of views and the attention. I started making videos on TikTok that I knew could go viral.”",
            "“However, the reason I went viral in the first place was because I made something honest and authentic to myself. Once I began working for the ‘likes,’ I realised I had started losing my personality and my focus and I broke away from that mindset.” ",
            "Brown skin, white voice",
            "When you move to a new place, you try to fit in and Rahul was no different. “In pop culture, the brown guy is always the IT chap, the sidekick — never the main role,” he says, adding that though the scenario is changing now, it is not fast enough. “I wanted to fit in so bad I changed my accent, despite being able to sing well.”",
            "“I can’t name a single brown artiste who sings in English,” says Rahul. “I think it’s because Western culture looks at the Indian accent as a bad thing and we ourselves look at it in that context. Most artistes, such as ABBA and myself as well, go with an American accent as it is rather generic.” ",
            "“I wish I didn’t have to do that. I would tell people I went to an international school in India with a lot of American kids, that’s why I have an American accent. But now, I’m honest about my accent because I don’t want another kid who comes here to feel compelled to do the same thing.”",
            "Collaboration with Zach Nahome",
            "Rahul began working with producer Zach Nahome soon after the success of ‘Nobody’ in 2021. It was Nahome, who has worked with other popular UK-based artistes such as Slowthai, Bakar and PinkPantheress among others, who urged Rahul to tell his story.",
            "\nArtiste Renao\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n",
            "“Zach encouraged me to tell people ‘where you’re from and what you’re trying to achieve’.” And I realised I didn’t come all this way to not be authentic. It gave me the confidence to be open and honest about my music.”",
            "Though Rahul was born in Bengaluru and grew up listening to Western music with his parents, as a family they hail from Kerala. “I didn’t listen to a lot of Indian music as a child, but my grandmother used to sing to me all the time. I felt instead of using ‘bhangra’ beats or other typical Indian stylings, I would use my grandmother’s voice / song in my music.” ",
            "‘Always Be Me’ with the vocal stylings of Rahul’s grandmother, Yamuna Bhai, is part of his recently-released nine-track EP, ",
            ". The EP which came out on June 2 has garnered over 500k hits on various streaming platforms since then. ",
            "Stage name ",
            "“I’m not British, I’m Indian and the idea behind ‘A Space Between Orange and Blue’ is that when you add orange and blue together you get brown. Orange stands for the colours that make the Karnataka flag and blue for the British one. I know there are a lot of artistes making English music in India right now, but they should be able to do it globally as well.” ",
            "“I think it’d be so cool to have an Indian girl band,” he adds.",
            "\nA Space Between Orange and Blue\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n",
            "Talking about his stage name, Rahul says he was googling names in different languages when he came across ‘Renao,’ which is Chinese for “lively or bustling”. “That is how I wanted my work to be so I took it up as my stage name. Besides Rahul is quite common in India now — I know two other Indian artistes with the same name,” he laughs.",
            "As a songwriter, Rahul believes his best work and inspiration come from experiencing life. “I need to be able to live my life in order to be able to make the music I want to.” ",

            "like we are witnessing village life languidly unfold with all its mundaneness first hand. On the other hand, there is a subtle poetry that runs through the film, beginning from its title. So, it is definitely not an attempt to document reality. ",
            "Yashaswini, thankfully, inserts this intertitle at the beginning to clarify:-",
            "This is a work of fiction. Only people, places, and the work are real. For the rest, any resemblance to anything that might have actually happened or dreamt of is purely coincidental.",
            "The film’s inception itself was purely coincidental. Seven years ago, Yashaswini, when she visited her mother at a hospital, she saw and heard ",
            ", a handcrafted toy that rattles when rotated. Soon, she started finding it in other places, including her childhood. The rattling noise made it readily noticeable and Yashaswini was fascinated by it.",
            "“There are multiple ways of looking at it. It’s not just about the sound; the red glaze paper adds to its appeal. When you look through it, everything appears red. It evokes a particular sensation,” she says, “Upon closer inspection, you realise the paper is actually a piece from a 35-millimetre film reel. So, if you purchase a bunch of the toys, you can get the entire film cut into pieces.”",
            "The fascination for ",

            ".",
            "The poetic title refers to a lunar eclipse, when the moon turns red — arguably the only dramatic moment in the otherwise deliberately unobtrusive film. The cosmic event seems to break the monotony of the lives of the characters, who are the actual villagers of Daspara. ",
            "The film, which premiered in 2019 at the prestigious International Film Festival Rotterdam, was also showcased at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, Hamburg Film Festival, and Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, among others. It also won the Best Experimental Film award at Sharjah Film Program 2019. Vikalp Bengaluru, a community of documentary enthusiasts, in collaboration with Bangalore International Centre (BIC), screened the film last week at BIC. ",
            "Four years after the film’s premiere, Yashaswini feels she could have made it better. “I think I should have followed the strife of the villagers’ lives more. Right now, it is more folktale-ish, which is also enjoyable. And, I am glad the way it is. If I get another go at it, I would follow the nature of their lives a bit more,” she says.",
            "Though the film received appreciation in the festival circuit, Yashaswini feels she and her team were perhaps a bit overindulgent with the film’s form. At the BIC screening, an audience member asked her, “Did you worry about the film being obscure?”",
            "It is perhaps a question that most arthouse filmmakers mull over. “The truth is, when you are making the film, you’re immersed in its world. You want to try out a lot of things. You want to have a great time doing it. So, you don’t worry too much whether it can connect with the audience. Four years after making it, I think a lot more about it.”",

            "Coconut growers in Karnataka are losing sleep over the continuous fall in copra prices. The prevailing price in the market, they claim, is insufficient even to meet the input cost.",
            "In November 2022, the copra price was around ₹14,500 per quintal. The price started to fall in December 2022. For the last six months, the price has been around ₹8,000 per quintal. As of July 10, the ball copra was sold at ₹7,000 in Channarayapatna market in Hassan district, according to growers.",
            "Ramachandra, a coconut grower from Valagerahalli in Channarayapatna taluk, tends to 500 coconut trees. “Given the cost of cultivation and human labour, farmers should get at least ₹25,000 per quintal of copra. But, human labour and the value of land are never taken into account. The prevailing price is insufficient to meet our regular expenses, forget being able to repay loans,” he said.",
            "Coconut is grown on over 6.46 lakh hectares across Karnataka, and the production of ball copra is around 2.18 lakh metric tonnes per year. The fall in price came up for debate in the Legislature session as well. MLAs representing coconut-growing areas demanded financial incentives for growers in addition to the MSP of ₹11,750 per quintal.",
            "H.R. Naveen Kumar, Hassan district president of Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha (KPRS), said the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) had stopped procuring copra. “Copra is not a seasonal crop. Growers sell copra throughout the year. Hence, the NAFED should procure copra,” he said.",
            "In August 2022, the State Government had recommended to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices to fix a minimum support price of ₹16,730 per quintal. “This price was recommended by the Horticulture Department. The State Government should fix the price at ₹16,730 per quintal for the benefit of farmers,” he said.",
            "The Coconut Growers’ Struggle Committee of Channarayapatna has written to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in support of this demand. Besides that, the committee wants the government to fix the price of copra as per the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Commission’s report, which suggested a MSP that is 50% more than the average cost of production, announce a special package for coconut growers, and take measures to stop corruption in the procurement of copra through NAFED.",

            "which resembles a womb, and ‘Wave of Blossom’",
            "a gently blooming rose, every sculpture that is part of this exhibition comes from a deep well of emotion. “I am an emotional person, and I feel waves of it in my heart,” says Aarti. “This is my soul,” says the artist, who grew up in Gwalior and holds a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts with a specialization in sculpture. ",
            "Aarti says she has always wanted to be different. It is why she chooses to mould her sculptures out of clay, using only a wire cutter. Talking about what draws her to clay, she says, “If you make something out of fibre or metal, you need a mould. I don’t like being restricted by that.” ",
            "Instead, she creates aerial, handmade sculptures made without armature, an aesthetic honed over nearly 20 years, since she began back in 2004. “I chose this material because it is an ancient one and no one promotes it, “she says, pointing out that clay is often restricted to pottery or folk art. “It takes me six months to make every piece,” says Aarti, who moved to Bengaluru in 2009, after her marriage. ",
            "Holding out her mobile phone, she flips to her Instagram account to show what she is currently working on; another wave-based sculpture titled ‘Wave of Impermanence’",
            "“I am not sure what it will become,” says Aarti, who has exhibited both in India and the U.S., winning both national and international awards for her artwork. “I will know only when I finish,” says Aarti, claiming that she prefers to let the clay guide her. “I go with the flow,” she adds.

The AAP government said it was unconstitutional to appoint an “unelected figurehead who does not have any authority to act on his own except on the aid and advice of the elected Delhi government”.",
            "The government, represented by senior advocate A. M. Singhvi, said that the committee should ideally be chaired by the Chief Minister.",
            "The petition argued that the issue of pollution required crucial remedial measures, which include utilising treated water for agriculture, horticulture, or industrial purposes, preventing waste discharge and dumping, protecting floodplain zones, maintaining dredging flow, implementing plantations, and desilting drains. These actions would take a chunk of the Delhi budget. It was necessary that the Chief Minister and the elected government were not sidelined in the decision-making on the committee.\r",

            "The NGT had reasoned that the involvement of multiple authorities had affected accountability and added to the confusion.\r",
            "“Having multiple authorities in Delhi may be one of the reasons for not achieving success so far. There appears to be lack of ownership and accountability. Huge amount has already spent without desired results. Judicial oversight has continued for almost 29 years,” the NGT order had observed.\r",
            "“If the experiment is successful in Delhi, it may help the country as a whole facing huge problem of water pollution. The Committee will be free to conduct proceedings online/hybrid as found necessary. It will also be free to undertake field visits,” the Tribunal had said.",

            "In the current study, published in Advanced Materials Technologies, researchers have found a way to fabricate a composite containing a significant amount of polymer – up to 40% of the material weight – using a solution-process technique, specifically inkjet printing.",
            "\nThe super flexible, composite semiconductor material was developed by scientists in the Department of Materials Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), Bengaluru.\n ",
            "In contrast, previous studies have reported only up to 1-2% polymer addition. Interestingly, the approach enabled the semiconducting properties of the oxide semiconductor to remain unaltered with the polymer addition. The large quantity of polymer made the composite semiconductor highly flexible and foldable without deteriorating its performance. ",
            "The composite semiconductor is made up of two materials – a water-insoluble polymer, such as ethyl cellulose that provides flexibility, and indium oxide, a semiconductor which brings in excellent electronic transport properties.",
            "How researchers came up with the new material",
            "To design the material, researchers mixed the polymer with the oxide precursor in such a way that interconnected oxide nanoparticle channels are formed (around phase-separated polymer islands) through which electrons can move from one end of a transistor (source) to the other (drain), ensuring a steady flow of current. The key to form these connected pathways, the researchers found, was the choice of the right kind of water-insoluble polymer that does not mix with the oxide lattice when the oxide semiconductor is being fabricated.",
            "\n(Top) The composite semiconductor-based transistors on flexible Kapton substrate and (Below) envisioned fully printed flexible display.\n",
            "“This phase separation and the formation of polymer-rich islands helps in crack arrest, making it super flexible,” said Subho Dasgupta, Associate Professor in the Department of Materials Engineering, and corresponding author of the study. ",
            "Semiconductor materials are usually fabricated using deposition techniques, such as sputtering. Instead, Prof. Dasgupta’s team uses inkjet printing to deposit their material onto various flexible substrates ranging from plastic to paper. In the present study, a polymer called Kapton was used.",
            "Potential use scenarios",
            "Prof. Dasgupta adds that, in the future, such printed semiconductors can be used to fabricate fully printed and flexible television screens, wearables, and large electronic billboards alongside printed organic light emitting diode (OLED) display front-ends. These printed semiconductors will be low cost and easy to manufacture, which could potentially revolutionise the display industry. ",
            "The team has obtained a patent for their material, and plans to test its shelf life and quality control from device to device before it can be scaled up for mass production.",
