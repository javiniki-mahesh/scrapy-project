For 27/04/2023 meeting
======================


different people use different tags and structure 
        It took some time to understand the structure with different pages
                at some point of time came to an idea that anchor tags could help to find the content
----------------------------------------------------------

The idea is to find all anchor tags 
        identify the common pattern which is repeating most
        ex :
                https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/
                https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/
                        here title is repeating 
        when we identify the pattern we could consolidate all the pattern in an list/array
                we could use them for extracting the remaining content


through anchor tags we directly navigate to some content 
approach 1 : through anchor tag find its siblings
                drawback : sibling may not be having content or it is inside another tag so hard to get in this situation
approach 2 : from anchor tag back to parent tag and 
                                        get all child tags
                                        all these child tags having content
                challenge : as coming from parent tags 
                                direct sub tags may not having the information we need to go sub-tag -> sub-tag -> sub-tag .....-> sub-tag
                                        we don't know which tag having the information 

after having some considerations we could form an x-path and extract the data

doing hard coding to analysis and understand all these things


if the content not having anchor tags in some way in the content the total thing fails ---> we need to find some other approach

---------
we have 3 different situations
                1. direct tags from page
                2. making it structured url
                3. finding important tags
